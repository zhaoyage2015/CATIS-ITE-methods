# CATIS-ITE-methods

## Code Availability

This repository provides representative R scripts illustrating the main analytical workflow
used in the study, including data preprocessing, causal forest–based treatment effect modeling,
model validation, uplift (Qini) analysis, and partial dependence plots.

The scripts are shared for transparency of analytical methods.
Individual-level trial data are not publicly available and are therefore not included.

A complete and fully reproducible version of the analysis pipeline can be provided upon reasonable request.
